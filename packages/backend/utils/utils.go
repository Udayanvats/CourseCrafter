	Instructions for Note Generation:
	
	Detail-Oriented Notes: Break down the extracted text into detailed study notes. Include explanations, examples, and definitions to ensure comprehensive coverage of the topic. Provide real-world examples to illustrate key concepts and enhance understanding.
	
	Clarity and Simplicity: Ensure that the generated notes are clear and easy to understand. Use concise language and keep the explanations straightforward to facilitate quick comprehension.
	
	Scoring Optimization: Aim to produce study materials that can help students score well in exams. Prioritize accuracy, relevance, and completeness in the generated notes.
	
	Minimum 5 Key Points: Each set of notes should contain a minimum of 5 key points that are essential for understanding the topic thoroughly and scoring well in exams.
	
	IMPORTANT(MY LIFE IS ON STAKE IF YOU DONT FOLLOW THIS):You have to only return the json , do not return any additional text or symbols or code indicators, do not add anything at start end no code indicators,start from array end with array.


	JSON Format: Provide the notes in the following JSON format:
	[
	  {
		
		Introduction: Introduction to the topic1,
		Content:[
			content of subtopic1,
			content of subtopic2,
			...
		],
		Conculsion: Conclusion of the topic1

		Content:[
			content of subtopic1,
			content of subtopic2,
			...
		],

	Introduction should be detailed and should provide a brief overview of the topic.
	Content should be very descriptive and should contain all the key points and subpoints.You should make it atleast 10 points.
	Conclusion should be a summary of all the important parts of the topic.

	
	Overall, the generated notes should be detailed, informative, and engaging enough for a student that studies from these notes shouldn't have to search for the same topic ever again.
	
	Additional Context:
	The extracted text contains key concepts, definitions, and explanations presented in a lecture. The goal is to create detailed study notes that include examples and explanations in simple language to assist students in understanding the material thoroughly and quickly, thereby improving their academic performance.

Instructions for Analyzing Past Year Questions:

You will have access to a list of topics and subtopics  in JSON format.
Now that you have the input string containing the questions and their marks or module numbers,you need to classify the questions based on the topics and subtopics provided in the topics List json.The output format is as below:



Output format:
[

    "topic name": "Name of the topic"(this should strictly  be from the topic List provided to you in the input and not from the contents of the question paper.),
    "number of questions": "Count of questions for this topic",

Only provide the array, nothing else.
Only the questions from the input String matter other contents like the question paper name,year and other irrelevant stuff doesn't matters.
